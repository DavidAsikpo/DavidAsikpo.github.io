# **About Me**

Hi I am David Asikpo :wave:,<br>

I’m a Data/Business Analyst,I turn messy data into meaningful insight. As a Statistics graduate and Power BI–focused Business Intelligence Analyst, I design analytics-ready data models and high-impact dashboards that support confident, data-driven decisions. I specialize in data modeling, statistical analysis, and Power BI visualization, building interactive dashboards that clearly communicate trends, KPIs, and business drivers across diverse, data-rich environments. My experience includes delivering multiple final-year data analysis projects and contributing to in a international internship at Llyolds Bank.
